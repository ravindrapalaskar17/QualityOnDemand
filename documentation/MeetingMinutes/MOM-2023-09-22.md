## Agenda

* Open PRs
* Open Issues
* AOB

## Discussion of Open PRs

* [#216 Extend session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216) (Associated Issue [#220 Change duration of an active session](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/220))
  * Submitted as a replacement for [#162 Add PATCH operation](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/162), which is now closed
  * Based on feedback received, scope is limited to extending session durations only. PR remaned.
  * Two discussion points remain open with the PR:
    * New endpoint requires an associated security scheme (now agreed)
    * Should extending session durations beyond the maximum allowed for a new session (currently 1 day) be allowed?
  * **If participants have a view on whether sessions can be extended beyond 1 day maximum duration, please comment in the associated issue**
 
* [#217 issue_194_PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/217) (Associated Issue [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  * Two discussion points currently open
    * Exact relationship between `applicationConsumerId` and the end user, API consumer and other actors in the API transaction is not clear. In particular, for three-legged authentication, should the `applicationConsumerId` be provided at the authorisation stage (in the same way as, for example, `phoneNumber`)?
    * Should `applicationConsumerId` be a "top level" parameter in the `CreateSession` schema, or part of the `ApplicationServer` schema?
    * **Syed to clarify exact scope of `applicationConsumerId`, and maybe consider renaming**
    * **Participants with a view on either open point, or with additional open points, to comment in the associated issue before the next meeting**
