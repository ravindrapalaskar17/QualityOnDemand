## Sub Project Management

* Release v0.9.0 done
* Patrice Conil and Randy Levensalor added as additional maintainer of QoD Sub Project
* Shilpa Padgaonkar stepped back as code owner, Eric Murray and Randy Levaensalor added as codeowners
* Next meeting on August 11th: Eric will take the moderation


## Open Issues (including backlog)

* [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/31)
To be replaced by an issue to adapt to changes out of #8 in Commonalities

* [#45 Need to support ability to configure fallback qos](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/45)
Most potential customers are ok with a fallback to "default" class of QoS. Notion that implementation would be complex (at the moment) but limited market demand. To be kept in backlog.


* [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47)
PR #162 open. Agreed to implement first a minimum patch operation as described in comments. Behaviour behind patch of `duration` to be discussed first within the issue. Potentially an own endpoint necessary if the behaviour doesn't fit to a PATCH operation.

* [#51 Proposal of IpFlowDescription to allow asymmetric QoS flows and (re)introduce protocol definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/51)
Syed mentioned the need to describe flows also with the protocol type (TCP, UDP). Use case examples to be added as comments. Might not require the introduction of IPFlowDescriptions. Decision if to pull from backlog based later.

* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
Nice to have functionality for developers. Requires to maintain relation of QoD session resources to resource owner based (based on access token). Should if possible get part of v0.10.0. therefore backlog label deleted.

* [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)
Two options seen in discussion:
  * Use of comparisation operators on attributes. For that a definition in Commonalities (how to express in OAS) is pending. Challenge: need to be applied to complex object
  * Additional GET endpoint which delivers based on a profile object with required/desired parameters a list of QoD profiles which are fulfilling the required quality parameters (if existing). This would require a specific comparisation logic. GraphQL could be a blueprint, but QoD sub project should introduce that only if there is broader demand across CAMARA sub project. Discussion to be continued within issue.<br><br>

* [#158 Add linting GitHub actions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/158)
  PR #171 open for this, Randy will break it down into smaller PRs in order to introduce linting in steps.

* [#166 Extend QoS Profile queries to list profiles based on specific users or devices](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/166)
Missed to discuss => next call

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
See comments within issue. Probably no change to the API, only relevant for implementation of certain profiles. Discussion to be continued within the issue. 


* [#192 Change version number in main to v0.10.0-wip](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/192) Herbert will do a short PR with this change

* [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194) Discussion points (to be continues within the issue):
  * Main use would be to relate usage data from the network to a specific application of the API customer. Relevant for API customers who have different applications or application functions which they want to monitor regarding usage seperately. Assumption is that the application information will not come with the access token (as that would require different access token per application).
  * This functionality (add application ID to the API call) might be relevant across several CAMARA APIs -> potentially issue to be opened in Commonalities.

## Open PRs

* [#171 First pass for including linting for pull requests](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/171)
  Randy will split the PR into several smaller PRs to introduce linting step by step

* [#162 Add PATCH operation](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/162)
  See discussion of issue #47 (update: changed status of PR to "draft" as we first want to discuss the logic behind patching `duration`)


## API Roadmap

### Release 0.9.0

* Release 0.9.0 is done
* Prover implementations (PI) need to be updated, Herbert to create issues within the repositories

### Release 0.10.0

* September-October 2023? (as for DeviceStatus 0.6.0)
* Focus on stabilization of API definition, e.g. introduction of linting
* Changes expected from Authn/Authz discussion in Identity & Consent and from Notifiation/Subscription in Commonalities
* New features so far based on discussed issues
  * [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47) (minimal set of attributes which can be patched)
  * [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101) (incl authorization concept)
  * [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)


## AOB

* QoD maintainers are reqquested to actively support the resolution of issues which the sub project raised in Commonalities.
* The next call will be on August 11th, 2 PM CEST / 12:00 UTC
  * Herbert on vacation, Eric will moderate
