* Issues which are candidates for next release v0.11.0
* AOB

## Issues relevant for v0.10.0 (RC)

* [#239 Bring user friendly links within README into top position](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/239)
  * Fixes with PR #246 (merged during the call)
  * Issue closed

* [#238 Remove mobile from QoD scope](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/238)
  * As long as QoD is about the access line up to the home router there is no overlap with HomeDevices QoD (see [comment](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/238#issuecomment-1856862249) in issue)
  * Randy volunteered to prepare a PR with changes to the documentation (within YAML) and the README.md of the repository (issue assigned to him)

* [#241 Extend the QoD API documentation with details as to what happens when qosStatus changes from available to unavailable](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/241)
  * Agreed that this issue should be addressed within the documentation, a consistent behavior is across implementations is important
  * It's useful that the session resource will exist beyond the time where the qos session became unavailable to allow API consumer who don't use/receive notifications to get the status change and reason (e.g. if polling in regular intervals)
  * There will be no case where an "unavailable" QoS session will get "available" again. If we later will define such behavior (that the network tries to reestablish the requested QoS profile) we need to introduce another status (e.g. in context of issue #45, supporting fallback QoS)
  * Different options discussed, about how long the session resource should be preserved after the QoS session got unavailable:
    * An explicit delete by the API consumer can not be expected in all cases
    * Binding to requested duration could be difficult to implement
    * Emil proposed to keep the session resource for a fixed time after the session changed to unavailable
      * Time to be defined, should cover at least typical polling intervals
      * Emil will update his presentation with this proposal
  * Design target is to allow developers to decide between notifications and polling, both methods should be sufficient to get all important information

* [#242 Notifications](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/discussions/242)
  * The discussion topic is suggesting to send notifications for all changes of the status of the QoS Session resources, including the initial entering of "available" and the ones induced by API calls by the API consumer (e.g. delete of the QoS session)
  * Discussed that it is important to document in which cases notifications will be send
    * As far as possible within the API documentation
    * In addition within the test definitions (relevant documentation for implementators)
  * Sending a notification in all cases of status change is in line with the above design target, that notifications should be sufficient to get all important information
  * Agreement to create an issue out of the discussion, to document the discussed behavior within the API documentation and test definitions
  * ACTION POINT - Herbert to create the issue

## Issues which are candidates for next release v0.11.0

These issues have the label "QoD" within https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues.
All sub project contributors are asked to add their views to the issues, so that we can start to work on the issues beginning of next year.

* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
  * Left over from v0.10.0 as discussion couldn't be closed, now planned for v0.11.0
  * The discussions have dependencies with #244, see below
  * PR #228 on hold (draft) until the discussions are closed
  * From last call:
    * phoneNumber not allowed within query parameter => operation has to be changed to POST, with body for filter parameters
    * this change will allow then to use complete `device` object to be added for filtering

  * [#166 Extend QoS Profile queries to list profiles based on specific users or devices](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/166)
    * To be defined as new endpoint, POST operation with `device` object in body
    * Note: identifying the device via phoneNumber might be not sufficient to return the applicable profiles, e.g. in case a device is served by multiple slices or APNs
    * Further discussion within the issue

* [#243 Rework definition of QoS flow(s)](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/243)
  * New issue as discussed within last meeting

* [#244 Align securitySchemes and security of QOD API spec with IdentityAndConsentManagement](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/244)
  * New issue for v0.11.0 as discussed in last call
  * Herbert proposed an additional issue to "Ensure that the QoD API does not reveal additional PII" beyond the personal information provided by the API consumer. E.g. if the device is identified by IP address, the session information should not in addition contain the phoneNumber and vice versa. Such requirement should be documented within the test definitions. Herbert to create the issue.

* [#245 Update and enhance test definition file for QOD API](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/245)
  * New issue as discussed within last year


The following two issues, labeled as "discussions" are related to the above issues:

* [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  * Issue and related PR currently on hold until it is clarified which information about the application will be already be already part of the autorization token and can be derived from there => #244

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
  * Could most probably be one option to define flows => #243 


## v0.11.0 Release scope & timeline

Scope of the next release v0.11.0 is described by the issues discussed above + any impacts from releases of Commonalities (v0.10.0 is in line with Commonalities v0.2.0, so any changes coming with further releases of Commonalities)
Time horizon is April/Mai 2024 (definitely after MWC Barcelona).

## AOB

* We will skip the call on December 29th
* The next call will be on Friday January 12th, 14:00 CET / 13:00 GMT / 13:00 UTC
* The invites for 2024 will come from the LFX Zoom platform and will be distributed via the mailing list
* For best user experience it is recommended to have an Linux Foundation account, with the same email address behind like for the mailing list subscription. An account can be created on https://openprofile.dev. The account and profile will give also access to the recordings of the meetings and to the wiki.camaraproject.org
* We will use the https://wiki.camaraproject.org for minutes going forward
