  - previous discussion and decisions see [MOM-2023-08-11.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-08-11.md)

* [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)
   - previous discussion and decisions see [MOM-2023-08-11.md](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/blob/main/documentation/MeetingMinutes/MOM-2023-08-11.md)
   - Most probably only few profile within mobile networks, probably more in fixed networks upcoming
   - Decision: not in scope for v0.10.0, we will wait until a larger number of profiles are in use

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
  - no update, discussion to be continued in the issue

* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
  - depending on authentication/identity of API consumer
  - DT considers to make a proposal

* [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47)
  - Discussion
    - Change of session duratin should be done with an explicit endpoint which will allow to include the necessary logic behind. "Patching" the duration would be unclear regarding impacts.
    - Patching notificationAuthToken: to be reconsidered after new notification/event approach is concluded in Commonalities (including security concept)
  - Decision
    - PR for new endpoint to change session duratin (Emil)
    - no further PATCH operation as of now

* [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/31)
  - waits for general solution in Commonalities. 
  - request to participate in the discussion there (especially https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/56)
