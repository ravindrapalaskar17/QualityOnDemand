## Agenda

* Housekeeping
* Release 0.10.0
* Open PRs
* Open Issues
* AOB


## Housekeeping

* Next call on Oct 20th collides with OGW f2f meeting in London. Decided to keep the call.

## API Roadmap

### Release 0.10.0

* Focus of the release v0.10.0 is to adapt to the current changes within Commonalities
* Enhancement which are ready will be taken into the release, but we don't wait for them. They can go into a following release.
* Background is that some operators (e.g. DT) need to decide which version to implement for customers. v0.9.0 would require breaking changes shortly afterwards to get compliant to Commonalities (e.g. event and notification structure)
* If possible: PRs for v0.10.0 ready until next call (Oct 20th), RC ready in the call afterwards (Nov 3rd)

## Discussion of Open PRs

* [#216 Extend session duration](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/216) (Associated Issue [#220 Change duration of an active session](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/220))
  * Open discussion point from previous meeting:
    * Should extending session durations beyond the maximum allowed for a new session (currently 1 day) be allowed?
  * Discussion result:
    * New remaining session duration should not exceed the 1 day maximum duration (remaining duration + extension <= 86400 seconds)
    * If new remaining session duration would exceed 86400 seconds, no error should be raised but session duration set to value where the remaining session duration is about 86400 seconds
 
* [#217 issue_194_PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/217) (Associated Issue [#194 Add Application Function Id (afId) or Sponsor Id](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/194)
  * Two discussion points are still open
    * Naming of the identifier should be changed to express the relationship to API consumer (identity within access token). According to Syed the main purpose is to allow the API consumer to track the API and resource usage more granular then on level of API consumer identity only. An API consumer could have different application functions which they might want to see differentiated on a bill. "applicationConsumerId" is misleading here.
    * If the Id is related (one to one?) to an application (server) it would make sense to move it into the applicationServer object. But that might be specific to QoD API and not apply to other APIs. The enhancement should be discussed within Commonalities first.
    * **Syed to clarify exact scope of `applicationConsumerId`, and maybe consider renaming. Also to clarify the expecation of (usage) data collected related to the Id by the network (to allow estimation of implementation effort)**
    * **Syed to address and drive the topic in Commonalities as it might be relevant for further APIs, not only QoD**
    * **Participants with a view on either open point, or with additional open points, to comment in the associated issue before the next meeting**

## Discussion of Open Issues

### New Issue since last meeting

* [#223 Operation tags in global tags element](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/223)
  * Tags are relevant to sort operations e.g. within swagger editor (see [View it on Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/release-0.9.0/code/API_definitions/qod-api.yaml))
  * **Rafal to propose necessary change to fulfill the linting rule as a PR**

### Issues For Next Release

* [#221 Change event structure and notification according to Design Guidelines changes](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/221)
  * A revised model for callbacks is agreed and merged within Commonalties (see Commonalities [#56](https://github.com/camaraproject/Commonalities/pull/56))
  * The revised model must be adopted by QoD for release 0.10.0
  * **Jose Luis volunteers to prepare the necessary PR (update after call: [PR #224](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/224) available for review)**

* [#173 Add support for DSCP markings for QoD sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/173)
  * No update, waiting for Randy to summarize the results of the discussion and make a specific proposal for required API changes and their impact on API behaviour
  
* [#101 List endpoint for active sessions of authenticated user](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/101)
  - DT team is working on a proposal, Akos will provide a PR when ready (might not make it into v0.10.0)
  - Jose has commented in the issue. TEL is working on a proposal, e.g. elaborating the requirements around which sessions are allowed to be discovered by certain client, which filters may apply to that query, e.g. searching for sessions for certain MSISDN
 
* [#47 Include support for /PATCH sessions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/47)
  - No update, previous comments still valid
    - Use case of refreshing OAuth token for callbacks remains open
    - Jose to review new approach to callbacks being defined by Commonalities to see if this issue is covered there. If not, this requirement can continue to be discussed within the issue.


### Backlog Issues (only partly discussed)

* [#51 Proposal of IpFlowDescription to allow asymmetric QoS flows and (re)introduce protocol definitions](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/51)
  - Stale issue
  - Herbert: it isn't a DT issue or requirement, it was originally brought up by Ericsson and just reported by DT. 
  - There are no requirements for this capability yet identified

* [#147 Extend the query capabilities for Qos Profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/147)
  - No updates on this issue
