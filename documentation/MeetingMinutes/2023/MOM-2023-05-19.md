## Updates and housekeeping
  * [Release Planning v0.9.0](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/136)
    * Plan for today:
      * Final decision which PRs will be merged for v0.9.0 (if not already done)
      * Creation of prerelease of v0.9.0 (v.0.9.0-rc1, "Release Candidate")
      * Purpose of the release candidate is that implementations can be started in order to identify bugs or other implementation obstacles
      * For that the API definition and its structure is important. Descriptions can be changed independent of that. 
    * Note: PR [Updated method for identifying devices by IPv4 address #139](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/139) is already merged


## Adding new maintainer

* Proposal to add Ramesh Shanmugasundaram (Spry Fox Networks, @sfnuser) to the list of Maintainers [PR](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/148) 
* Unfortunately missed to address in the call ... current maintainers should vote with their approval to the [pull request #148](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/148)

* Discussion 
  * Q: can the current profile names (QOS_E, QOS_S, QOS_M, QOS_L) continued to be used. A: yes, that was the intention of keeping the format of QoSProfileName flexible.
  * Three smaller change request to the PR raised (Randy noted them down). Including dealing with the warnings raised by swagger. Jose will help with these, as he has solved them also within PR #151

    * Herbert will ask DT team to check for the needed changes

* [#146 Format 'ipv4' is more restrictive than the pattern in Data Type 'Ipv4Address'](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/146)
