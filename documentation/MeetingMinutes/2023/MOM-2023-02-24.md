## Issue [#34 Resolving ueAddr ambiguity when it is the UE private address](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/34)

* Pull Request [#123 Update UeId definition in qod-api.yaml](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/123)
* Please provide your comments within the open PR (will be kept open at least until Friday March 3rd, and then until a cool down of 2 business days happened)
* Proposal to change paramater "port" with public IPv4 address into "public port" (Update: done by Eric)

## PR [#124 Qod profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/121)

* Discussion: PR on backlog item #7 ... proposing a function to create QoS profiles
  * The discussion started on the PR should first be done within one or two issues
  * A dynamic creation of new QoS profiles shouldn't be offered to developers, but a discovery of QoS profiles offered by a network operator would be very helpful
  * Also the possibility to get the QoS profiles as a machine readable object structure. The paramaters need an intensive discussion
  * The current PR will be closed by Randy and he will summarize the discussion and learnings in one or two new issues which will probably superseed the existing issue #7. 

## Further open issues (w/o backlog items)

* see [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues)

New issues:
* [#115 Default duration should be only an example](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/115)
  * Proposal to omit default value of 86400 from YAML (leave it to network operator or developer), but keep the maximum of 86400 seconds
    * DT asked to do the PR

As of last call:
* [#97 Alignment with API design guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/97)
    * In work with the (merged) PR #104 and the discussion about terms within #90 (see above)
* [#84 IPv6-object will be generated instead of a String](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/84)
    * A regex is needed here which will sufficiently restrict the input ot valid IPv6 addresses => proposals are welcome
    * Patrice recommened [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) as a good site to check regex patterns.
    * 2023-02-24: no update
* [#81 Introducing error code 501 "Not Implemented"](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/81)
    * DT will do a PR
* [#75 Clarify usage of security scheme in call back](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/75)
    * and related issue [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/31)
    * DT is currently testing a solution and might make a proposal here afterwards
    * Further proposals are also welcome
