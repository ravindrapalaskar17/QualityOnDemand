## Qod relevant terms for Commonalities glossary

* See issue [#90 Update commonalities glossary with qod-subproject relevant terms](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/90)
* **Request for all:** please review the definition proposed by Jose in https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/90#issuecomment-1456609800. Jose will contribute the resulting definitions at latest on March 15th to Commonalities.
* New PR [Rename properties to new terms #129](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/129) prepared to execute the changes within API definition and documentation. Will be merged after the final decision about snake_case vs camelCase in Commonalities

## Issue [#34 Resolving ueAddr ambiguity when it is the UE private address](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/34)

* Pull Request [#123 Update UeId definition in qod-api.yaml](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/123) closed as the current discussion requires a new proposal. See continued discussion within the issue for Eric's proposal.
* Emil presented his discussion paper with concept and alternative API design, see [Discussion paper for Issue#34 and PR#123 #127](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/127)
  * Eric asked to add a third scenario where both local/private UE address and observed/public UE address are collected on the device app and used within the QoD session create
  * We will use the agreed term device instead of UE
  * A decision between local/observed vs private/public IP might need a vote
