## Updates
* New/additional maintainer from Verizon: Mahesh Chapalamadugu [PR 132](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/132)

## PR [Rename properties to new terms #129](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/129)
* Based on the decisions in [#90](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/90)
* Akos and Emil offered to do a review before merge 
* PR will be kept open until Wednesday March 29th 
* It's important to merge the PR soon as a prerequisite for the next PRs (the changes are across the complete YAML and documentation and merge conflicts would unavoidable)

## Issue [#34 Resolving ueAddr ambiguity when it is the UE private address](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/34)
* Emil presented and explained the added scenario(s) within [UE IP address and ports in QoD.PA3.pdf](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/files/11013180/UE.IP.address.and.ports.in.QoD.PA3.pdf) (attached at issue comment)
* Proposal is to ask developers to add all attributes they can observe (easily) and not make the minimum set dependent on network configurations
* Device port(s) might be neither helpful for device identification nor for (current simple) flow description - could be omitted completetly
* Port(s) should to with the IP addresses into the Device object - Emil will change the proposal accordingly
* Discussion to be continued within the issue (but should be concluded soon, see "Release Planning" in AOB)

## Issue [#125 Adds service provider defined QoS profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/125)
* Randy presented the updated proposal
* Throughput/bandwidth replaced with neutral term "rate"
* Q: intended for mobile and/or fixed - A: both
* Burstrate needs a description/definition of a burst (e.g. duration, percentage of time etc)
* Discussed if it would make sense to add a "type" of profile ('best effort' vs 'guaranteed') in addition to the attribute which allow to define theses characteristics (e.g. for easier search). Emil will have a closer look and might make a proposal into this direction. Term "GBR" should not be used as telco and mobile specific
* There was also a request to support (backwards compatibility with) the current QoS Profile enum

## Further open issues (w/o backlog items)

* see [https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues)

### New issues:

* [Providing initial test case contribution #133](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/133)
  * As per discussion on [camaraproject/WorkingGroups#61](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/61), DT will provide basic tests with Cucumber framework using Java and Maven implementation

### Open issues:

* [#115 Default duration should be only an example](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/115)
  * Proposal to omit default value of 86400 from YAML (leave it to network operator or developer), but keep the maximum of 86400 seconds
  * PR to be done (DT, after PR #129 is merged)
* [#97 Alignment with API design guidelines](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/97)
    * In work with the (merged) PR #104 and #129 (see above)
* [#84 IPv6-object will be generated instead of a String](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/84)
    * A regex is needed here which will sufficiently restrict the input ot valid IPv6 addresses => proposals are welcome
    * Patrice recommened [https://regex101.com/](https://regex101.com/) as a good site to check regex patterns.
    * 2023-03-24: no update
* [#31 Ensure secure handling of callback URL](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/31)
    * See discussion within the issue
    * Need to be aligned with the discussion in Commonalities: [Unified Notfication/Event management #156](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/156) - therefore on hold in QoD

### Issues closed / to be closed:

* none

## AOB

* **Next Call**
  * We will skip April 7th (Good Friday)
  * The next call will be therefore on April 21st, 2 PM CEST / 12:00 UTC
* **Planning for release v0.9.0**
  * Aim is to have a release of v0.9.0 before summer / within June
  * There should be a release candidate (pre-release in Github terms) 4-6 weeks in advance to give implementators a chance to identify potential bugs/fixes necessary for the release, and adapt documentation and test cases
  * The solutions for the two issues [#34 Resolving ueAddr ambiguity when it is the UE private address](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/pull/34) and [#125 Adds service provider defined QoS profiles](https://github.com/camaraproject/QualityOnDemand/issues/125) should be at least part of the release v0.9.0
  * Herbert will create an issue with a proposed planning for the release (milestones and content)
